Description: Configuration file parser library - development files
 dot.conf is a simple-to-use and powerful configuration-file parser
 library written in C. The configuration files created for dot.conf
 look very similar to those used by the Apache Webserver. Even
 Container-Directives known from httpd.conf can easily be used in the
 exact same manner as for Apache-Modules. It supports various types of
 arguments, dynamically loadable modules that create their own
 configuration options on-the-fly, a here-documents feature to pass
 very long ARG_STR data to your app, and on-the-fly inclusion of
 additional config files.
 .
 This package contains the development files necessary to build
 programs using the dotconf library.
